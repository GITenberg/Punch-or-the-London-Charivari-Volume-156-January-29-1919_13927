    <h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

    <p>Peace is only a matter of time, says Mr. HUGHES. The
    ex-Kaiser is said to be of the opinion that Mr. HUGHES might
    have been more explicit as to who is going to get that
    "time."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Meanwhile the ex-Kaiser is growing a beard. He evidently has
    no desire to share the fate of "Wilhelmshaven."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>After reading the numerous articles on whether he should be
    charged with murder or not, we have come to the conclusion that
    the answer now rests solely between "Yes" or "No."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. DE VALERA has been appointed a delegate of the Irish
    Republic to the Peace Conference. The fact that he has not
    ordered the Peace Conference to come to Brixton prison should
    satisfy doubters like <i>The Daily News</i> that Sinn Fein can
    be moderate when it wants to.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>People in search of quiet amusement will be glad to know
    that there will be an eclipse of the sun on May 29th.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Owing to the overcrowding of Tube trains we understand there
    is some talk of men with beards being asked to leave them in
    the ticket offices.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is reported that an All-Tube team has applied for
    admission to the Rugby Union.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A large number of forged five-pound notes are stated to be
    in circulation in London. The proper way to dispose of one is
    to slip it between a couple of genuine fivers when paying your
    taxi fare.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The ancient office of Town Crier of Driffield, which carries
    with it a retaining fee of one pound per annum, is vacant.
    Several Army officers anxious to better themselves have applied
    for the job.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A large number of "sloping desks," made specially for
    Government Departments, are offered for sale by the Board of
    Works. The bulk of them, it is understood, slope at 3.30
    P.M.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The mysterious disappearance of sheep from Barnstaple has
    led to the report that some Government Department has fixed a
    price for sheep.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"It is not practicable," says the London Electric Railway
    Company, "for passengers to enter Tube cars at one door and
    leave by the other, because the end cars have only one door."
    The idea of reserving these cars for persons getting in or out,
    but not both, appears to have been overlooked.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is no truth in the report that the lodging, fuel and
    light allowance of Officers is to be raised from two shillings
    and sevenpence to two shillings and sevenpence halfpenny per
    day, the cost of living having increased since the Peninsular
    War.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"What is reported to be the largest sapphira in the world,"
    says a contemporary, "disappeared when the Bolshevists took
    Kieff." We suspect that the largest living Ananias had a hand
    in the affair.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is not surprising to learn, following the Police Union
    meeting, that the burglars have decided to "down jemmies"
    unless the eight-hour night is conceded.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The rumour that there was a vacant house in the Midlands
    last week has now been officially denied.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>With reference to the Market Bosworth woman who, though
    perfectly healthy, has remained in bed for three years, until
    removed last week by the police, it now appears that she told
    the officers that she had no idea it was so late.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"What can be done to make village life more amusing?" asks
    <i>The Daily Mirror</i>. We are sorry to find our contemporary
    so ignorant of country life. Have they not yet heard of Rural
    District Councils?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>An Oxted butcher having found a wedding ring in one of the
    internal organs of a cow, it is supposed that the animal must
    have been leading a double life.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"In order to live long," says Dr. EARLE, "live simply."
    Another good piece of advice would be: "Simply live."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A Streatham man who has been missing from his home since
    November, 1913, has just written from Kentucky. This disposes
    of the theory that he might have been mislaid in a Tube
    rush.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"Distrust of lawyers," Mr. Justice ATKIN told the boys of
    Friars School recently, "is largely caused by ignorance of the
    law." Trust in them, on the other hand, is entirely due to
    ignorance of the cost.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Giving evidence at Marylebone against a mysterious foreigner
    charged with using a forged identity book, the police said they
    did not know the real name and address of the man. The Bench
    decided to obviate the difficulty in the matter of the
    address.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>In a Liverpool bankruptcy case last week the debtor stated
    that he had lost six hundred pounds in one day rabbit-coursing.
    The Receiver pointed out that he could have almost bought a new
    set of rabbits for that.</p>

    <h2>GETTING OUT.</h2>

    <p>"If you belong to any of the following classes," said the
    Demobilisation advertisement, "do nothing." So Lieut. William
    Smith did nothing.</p>

    <p>After doing nothing for some weeks he met a friend who said,
    "Hallo, aren't you out yet?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet," said William, looking at his spurs.</p>

    <p>"Well, you ought to <i>do</i> something."</p>

    <p>So Lieut. William Smith decided to do something. He was a
    pivotal-man and a slip-man and a one-man-business and a
    twenty-eight-days-in-hospital man and a W.O. letter ZXY/999
    man. Accordingly he wrote to the War Office and told them
    so.</p>

    <p>It was, of course, a little confusing for the authorities.
    Just as they began to see their way to getting him out as a
    pivotal man, somebody would decide that it was quicker to
    demobilise him as a one-man-business; and when this was nearly
    done, then somebody else would point out that it was really
    much neater to reinstate him as a slip-man. Whereupon a
    sub-section, just getting to work at W.O. letter ZXY/999, would
    beg to be allowed a little practice on William while he was
    still available, to the great disgust of the medical
    authorities, who had been hoping to study the symptoms of
    self-demobilisation in Lieut. Smith as evidenced after
    twenty-eight days' in hospital.</p>

    <p>Naturally, then, when another friend met William a month
    later and said, "Hallo, aren't you out yet?" William could only
    look at his spurs again and say, "Not yet."</p>

    <p>"Better go to the War Office and have a talk with somebody,"
    said his friend. "Much the quickest."</p>

    <p>So William went to the War Office. First he had a talk with
    a policeman, and then he had a talk with a porter, and then he
    had a talk with an attendant, and then he had a talk with a
    messenger girl, and so finally he came to the end of a long
    queue of officers who were waiting to have a talk with
    <i>somebody</i>.</p>

    <p>"Not so many here to-day as yesterday," said a friendly
    Captain in the Suffolks who was next to him.</p>

    <p>"Oh!" said William. "And we've got an army on the Rhine
    too," he murmured to himself, realising for the first time the
    extent of England's effort.</p>

    <p>At the end of an hour he calculated that he was within two
    or three hundred of the door. He had only lately come out of
    hospital and was beginning to feel rather weak.</p>

    <p>"I shall have to give it up," he said.</p>

    <p>The Captain tried to encourage him with tales of gallantry.
    There was a Lieutenant in the Manchesters who had worked his
    way up on three occasions to within fifty of the door, at which
    point he had collapsed each time from exhaustion; whereupon two
    kindly policemen had carried him to the end of the queue again
    for air.... He was still sticking to it.</p>

    <p>"I suppose there's no chance of being carried to the
    <i>front</i> of the queue?" said William hopefully.</p>

    <p>"No," said the Captain firmly; "we should see to that."</p>

    <p>"Then I shall have to go," said William. "See you
    to-morrow." And as he left his place the queue behind him
    surged forward an inch and took new courage.</p>

    <p>A week later William suddenly remembered Jones. Jones had
    been in the War Office a long time. It was said of him that you
    could take him to any room in the building and he could find
    his way out into Whitehall in less than twenty minutes. But
    then he was no mere "temporary civil-servant." He had been the
    author of that famous W.O. letter referring to Chevrons for
    Cold Shoers which was responsible for the capture of Badajoz;
    he had issued the celebrated Army Council Instruction,
    "Commanding Officers are requested to replace the pivots,"
    which had demobilised MARLBOROUGH's army so speedily; and, as
    is well known, HENRY V. had often said that without
    Jones&mdash;well, anyhow, he had been in the War Office a long
    time. And William knew him slightly.</p>

    <p>So William sent up his card.</p>

    <p>"I want to talk to somebody," he explained to Jones. "I
    can't manage more than of couple of hours a day in the queue
    just now, because I'm not very fit. If I could sit down
    somewhere and tell somebody all about myself, that's what I
    want. Any room in the building where there are no queues
    outside and two chairs inside. I'd be very much obliged to
    you."</p>

    <p>"I'll give you a note to Briggs," said Jones promptly. "He's
    the fellow to get you out."</p>

    <p>"Thanks <i>awfully</i>," said the overjoyed William.</p>

    <p>A messenger girl took him and the note to Captain Briggs.
    Briggs listened to the story of William's
    qualifications&mdash;or rather disqualifications&mdash;and
    considered for a moment.</p>

    <p>"Yes, we ought to get you out very quickly," he said.</p>

    <p>"Good," said William. "Thanks <i>awfully</i>."</p>

    <p>"Walters will tell you just what to do. He's a pal of mine.
    I'll give you a note to him."</p>

    <p>So in another minute the overjoyed William was following a
    messenger girl to the room of Lieutenant Walters.</p>

    <p>Walters was very cheerful. The thing to do, he said, was to
    go to Sanders. Sanders would get him out in half-an-hour. He'd
    give William a note, and then Sanders would do his best. The
    overjoyed William followed the messenger girl to Sanders.</p>

    <p>"That's all right," said Sanders a few minutes later. "We
    can get you out at once on this. Do you know Briggs?"</p>

    <p>"Briggs," said William, with a sudden sinking feeling.</p>

    <p>"I'll give you a note to him. He knows all about it. He'll
    get you out at once."</p>

    <p>"Thank you," said William faintly.</p>

    <p>He put the note in his pocket and strode briskly out in
    search of the dear old queue.</p>

    <p>"It will be quicker after all," he told himself, as he took
    his place at the end of the queue next to a Lieutenant in the
    Manchesters. ("Don't crowd him," said a policeman to William;
    "he wants air.")</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>And you think perhaps that the story ends here, with William
    in the queue again? Oh, no. William is a man of resource. The
    very next day he met another friend, who said, "Hallo, aren't
    you out yet?"</p>

    <p>"Not yet," said William.</p>

    <p>"My boy got out a month ago."</p>

    <p>"H-h-h-how?" said William.</p>

    <p>"Ah well, you see, he's going up to Cambridge. Complete his
    education and all the rest of it. They let 'em out at once on
    that."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said William thoughtfully.</p>

    <p>William is thirty-eight, but he has taken the great
    decision. He is going up to Cambridge next term. He thinks it
    will be quicker. He no longer stands in the queue for two hours
    every day; he spends the time instead studying for his Little
    Go.</p>

    <h3><i>RUS IN URBE.</i></h3>

    <p>The Selborne Society, which used to be a purely rural
    expeditionary force, has lately taken to exploring London, and
    personally-conducted tours have been arranged to University
    College in darkest Gower Street, where Sir PHILIP MAGNUS and
    Sir GREGORY FOSTER will act as guides, and to the Royal Courts
    of Justice, where Sir EDWARD MARSHALL HALL, K.C., "will
    describe the methods of conducting civil actions." What GILBERT
    WHITE would say to all this brick-and-mortar sophistication we
    do not dare to guess. All that we venture to do is to suggest
    one or two more urbane adventures.</p>

    <p>Why, for example, should not a visit be paid to the House of
    Lords, under the direction of the new LORD CHANCELLOR? Five
    minutes spent on the Woolsack in such company not only would be
    a treasured memory, but a liberal (or, at any rate, a
    coalition) education. After such an experience all the
    Selbornians should come away better fitted to climb the ascents
    which life offers.</p>

    <p>Again, if Sir HORACE MARSHALL, the Lord Mayor, invited the
    Society to the Mansion House they might be enormously
    benefited. Of turtle doves they naturally know all; GILBERT
    WHITE would have seen to that; but what do they know of turtle
    soup? Well, the LORD MAYOR would instruct them. He would show
    them the pools under the Mansion House where these creatures
    luxuriate while awaiting their doom; he would indicate the
    areas beneath the shell from some of which is extracted the
    calipash and from some the calipee; he might even induce the
    Most Worshipful Keeper of the Turtles, O.B.E., to discourse on
    the subject.</p>

    <p>Then there is New Scotland Yard. It would be a scandal for
    the members of the Selborne Society not to visit that home of
    amity and see all the New Scots at work in tracking down the
    breakers of the laws that are made in the picturesque building
    with the clock tower so close by. And not very distant is the
    War Office, where mobilisation-while-you-wait may be studied at
    first hand, we don't think. Indeed, London offers such
    opportunities that we shall be surprised if the Selborne
    Society ever looks at a mole or a starling again.</p>

    <h2>THE ROAD TO THE RHINE.</h2>

    <h3>BUSINESS LEAVE.</h3>

    <p>Of course we <i>know</i> demobilisation is proceeding apace.
    We <i>know</i> that pivotal men are simply pirouetting to
    England in countless droves. We know it because we see it in
    the papers (when they come), and it is a great source of
    comfort to us. But since it is six days' train journey and four
    days' lorry-hopping from where we sit guarding the wrong side
    of the river to the necessary seaport, perhaps they have
    forgotten us, or they are keeping all the pivots in this area
    for one final orgy of demobilisation at some future date, which
    for the moment I am not at liberty to disclose.</p>

    <p>At present my poor friend Cook is sitting in the Company
    Mess with his thoughts all of the inside of Army prisons,
    instead of the glowing pictures he used to have of himself
    exchanging his battle-bowler for the headgear of civilisation.
    He says I'm responsible for his state of mind, because I first
    put the idea into his head. Well, I did; but I don't see how
    you can blame the fellow who filled the shell if some silly ass
    hits it on the nose-cap with a hammer.</p>

    <p>It started like this. After the Demobilisation General Post
    had sounded Cook spent his time writing to everybody who did
    not know him well enough to down his chances, filled up all the
    forms in triplicate and packed his valise ready to start off
    any time of the day or night for England, home and wholesale
    hardware, which is his particular pivot. I may say here that
    nominally this business is run by him and his brother, and the
    fact that they are now both in the Army is probably the chief
    reason why the manager in charge is able to make the business
    pay. However, you know what people are; if they draw receipts
    from a business nothing will persuade them but that they must
    be there, "on the spot you know," to "look after it." So,
    seeing his face grow longer and longer as the days went by
    without the Quarter-Master coming round and handing him his
    ration trilby hat, civvy suit and the swagger cane he hopes
    for, I said, "Why don't you put in for two months' business
    leave?"</p>

    <p>The air was at once rent with a fearful rush of leaves of
    his A.B. 153, and he ceased to take any interest in his platoon
    from that moment. In vain I urged upon him the consummate folly
    of neglecting to inquire more closely into the case of a
    reprobate in No. 11 Platoon who had so far forgotten all sense
    of discipline as to set out his kit with haversack on the left
    instead of the right (or <i>vice-versâ</i>, I forget which, but
    the Sergeant-Major spotted it.). He even went the length of
    saying he didn't care a cuss; and when I asked him
    sarcastically if he had forgotten the Platoon Commander's
    pamphlet-bible, "Am I offensive enough?" he said he thought he
    was, and I agreed with him.</p>

    <p>When the whole mess-room was simply a-flutter with torn-out
    leaves from his A.B. 153, representing his abortive attempts to
    put down his application succinctly and plausibly, we all began
    to take an interest in his case. We crowded round and offered
    him most valuable hints. Together we got through two very
    pleasant evenings and three or four A.B.'s 153, and still the
    application remained in a tentative state. We got on all right
    to start with, but it was after the "I have the honour to
    submit for the approval and recommendation of the Commanding
    Officer this my application for two months' business leave"
    that we got stuck.</p>

    <p>Of course <i>I</i> know it was no use, anyway. I have seen
    these things go forward before. They have no chance.</p>

    <p>It was then that a stroke of genius (unfortunate, as it
    turned out, but a stroke of genius nevertheless) occurred to
    me. "Why not say that your manager is a complete fool and in
    his hands the business is going to rack and ruin?" I said. He
    bit at it like a tiger, and only the law of libel prevented him
    putting it into execution there and then;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> but all the same we had a
       jolly fine argument (six of us) about it for some three
       hours, and nobody got put out of the room for introducing
       acrimony into the discussion.</p>

    <p>Finally, he said that he was sure his brother wouldn't mind
    his saying it about <i>him</i>, and the application went in as
    follows:&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>To Adjutant, First Crackshire Regt.</i></p>

    <p>Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to submit for the approval and
    recommendation of the Commanding Officer this my application
    for two months' business leave in the following special
    circumstances:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The necessity of my presence in the business (wholesale
    hardware) has become more and more urgent of late. It is
    imperative that I should get home at once owing to the total
    incapability of my partner to carry out simple directions which
    are dictated by letters, and it is no exaggeration to say that
    the business, which has been built up almost entirely by my
    efforts, must inevitably collapse unless it receives my
    personal attention at once.</p>

    <p>My address would be, etc., etc., London.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I am, Sir,</p>

            <p>Your obedient Servant, etc., etc.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Adjutant looked serious when he read it. So did Cook,
    for he thought the Adjutant had noted the London address and
    had remembered the business was in Bristol. But it was all
    right. It wasn't that at all really. Pencil and squared paper
    are poor means of conveying information at any time, and when
    the Adjutant had been assured that the business was really
    "wholesale hardware," and not "wholesale hardbake," as he had
    first read it, everything went swimmingly. The C.O. signed it
    and off it went on its momentous journey. Cook began to take a
    renewed interest in his platoon, and, having discovered the
    recalcitrant one of No. 11 actually coming on parade with only
    the front of the tip of his bayonet-scabbard polished, he took
    a fiendish delight in seeing the criminal writhing under the
    brutal and savage sentence of three days' C.B.</p>

    <p>A week later he got a great surprise. His brother-partner
    turned up with a draft of men and found himself posted to the
    battalion. The brothers met, as only brothers can, with the
    words, "What the deuce are you doing here?" Highly elated, Cook
    told him about the application for business leave and gloated
    over his chances of being home first, and on full pay too. His
    brother was intensely amused, and they both laughed heartily,
    when he told us that he himself, while waiting at the
    reception-camp with the draft, had put in much the same kind of
    application, saying the same kind of things about Cook.</p>

    <p>But when they realised that both applications would be
    forwarded to the same Divisional Headquarters for consideration
    the joke lost some of its savour. And when the Adjutant called
    them up and handed the two returned applications <i>pinned
    together</i> both brothers needed all their qualities of
    toughness and rigidity which, as I understand, are acquired in
    the wholesale hardware business.</p>

    <h2>TEACHING TOMMY.</h2>

    <p>Here is a simple method of aiding the admirable efforts of
    educational Staff-Officers in the army.</p>

    <p>Let all Regimental Orders be interspersed with items of
    information likely to be of use in civilian life.
    Thus:&mdash;</p>

    <p>53. ... will be rendered to this office, in triplicate, by
    noon to-morrow.</p>

    <p>53A. <i>Etiquette, Points of</i>. It is not considered
    correct to address an Archbishop as "Archie" unless one is on
    terms of considerable intimacy with him. In writing to a
    Duchess never commit the vulgar error of putting a stamp on the
    envelope; the sixth footman in a ducal household is always
    provided with a fund in respect of unpaid postage on incoming
    correspondence.</p>

    <p>54. ... is placed out of bounds to all troops on account of
    an outbreak of mumps.</p>

    <p>54A. <i>Data, Geographical</i>.&mdash;Of all fish those of
    the Bay of Biscay are perhaps the best nourished. An isthmus is
    a piece of land which saves another piece of land from being an
    island. The principal exports of Germany are prisoners of
    war.</p>

    <p>55. ... to be read on three consecutive parades.</p>

    <p>55A. <i>Theory</i>, <i>Untenable</i>,
    <i>Literary</i>.&mdash;The The theory that BACON was a
    pork-butcher and derived inspiration for <i>Hamlet</i> by
    gazing at the viands in his shop has now been disproved.</p>

    <p>56. ... and a sum of twopence per haircut will be chargeable
    against public funds.</p>

    <p>56A. <i>Courts, Foreign</i>.&mdash;The Sultan of Socotra is
    entitled to a salute of fourteen popguns and one catapult.
    Before approaching the throne of the Duke of the Djibouti one
    is required to take lessons from the Court Contortionist.</p>

    <p>57. ... and Company Commanders are reminded of their
    responsibility in this matter.</p>

    <p>57A. <i>World, the Animal</i>.&mdash;It is interesting to
    know that the inventor of the Tank first planned that engine of
    warfare while watching the peregrinations of the armadillo at a
    travelling menagerie. The efficacy of our blockade was such
    that large consignments of armadillo-fodder were prevented from
    reaching Germany, the consequent demise of all German-kept
    armadilloes thus robbing our enemy of the opportunity of
    devising a similar instrument.</p>

    <p>58. ... will parade in full marching order at Reveille.</p>

    <p>58A. <i>Facts, Historical</i>.&mdash;There once was a king
    who never smiled again, but history might have recorded a
    different verdict had His Majesty witnessed the spectacle of
    the Second-in-Command, on a frisky horse, trying to drill the
    Battalion.</p>

    <p>59. ... will therefore immediately submit rolls of all
    skilled organ-blowers of Category B ii.</p>

    <p>59A. <i>Information, General</i>.&mdash;If all the Treasury
    Notes circulated in the United Kingdom since 1914 were placed
    end to end they might reach from Bristol to Yokohama and back,
    but they would not constitute a sufficient inducement to a
    London taxi-driver.</p>

    <p>60. ... and this practice must cease forthwith.</p>

    <p>60A. <i>Query, Our Daily</i>.&mdash;What is Popocatapetl? Is
    it an indoor game, a cannibal tribe, a curative herb, or
    neither? Solutions are invited.</p>

    <p>There are two very advantageous points about this scheme:
    (1) The ingenious system of numbering would avoid interference
    with army routine, which must go on: and (2) men might be
    encouraged to read Regimental Orders.</p>

    <p>This suggestion is made without hope of fee or reward. Its
    author does not even ask for extra duty pay.</p>

    <p>"I wish 'as 'ow I warn't married."</p>

    <p>Mr. Punt crooned out the impious aspiration as he sorted a
    judicious modicum of hemp into the canary seed. He spoke in
    semi-soliloquy, yet quite loud enough to reach the vigilant ear
    of Mrs. Punt, who was dusting the cages at the other end of the
    live-stock store. She said nothing in reply, but her eye fixed
    itself upon him with a glint eloquent of what she might say
    later.</p>

    <p>"Why is that, Mr. Punt?" I asked encouragingly.</p>

    <p>"Why, it's on'y to-day, Sir, as I met a lidy, a widder lidy,
    friend o' Uncle George's down Putney way, as 'as one leg, a
    nice little bit o' 'ouse property and two great hauk's
    eggs."</p>

    <p>It did seem a rare combination of marriageable qualities. I
    asked the value of a great auk's egg, and was surprised to
    learn that a specimen had recently been sold at auction for
    something like three hundred pounds. I inquired whether all the
    great auks' eggs that came on the market were genuine, or
    whether "faked" specimens were to be met with. I had heard, I
    thought, of "faked" eagles' eggs.</p>

    <p>"Different kind o' bird altogether, Sir, and different kind
    o' egg. Can't very well be imitated. You didn't think as I said
    great 'awk, Sir?" he asked very anxiously.</p>

    <p>"No, no; I understand," I hastened to assure him.</p>

    <p>"The 'awk, Sir, is a bird o' the heagle kind; the hauk's a
    different kind altogether&mdash;web-footed, aquatic&mdash;was,
    I should rather say, seeing as 'ow 'e's un appily extinct. Hauk
    and 'awk, Sir&mdash;you take the difference?"</p>

    <p>I said that I thought the distinction was perceptible to a
    fine ear for the aspirate.</p>

    <p>The phrase took the little man's fancy wonderfully. "That's
    it, Sir," he exclaimed, beaming up delightedly at me. "You've
    'it it! Done it in one, you 'ave. 'Fine ear for the
    haspirate'&mdash;that's what my darter Maria 'ave and what I,
    for one, 'ave not. I'm not above confessing of it; 'tain't
    given to all of us to 'ave everything, as the ant said to the
    helephant when 'e was boasting about 'is trunk. Some there is
    as ain't got no ear for music&mdash;same as Joe Mangles, the
    grocer down the street, as 'as caught a heavy cold in 'is 'ead
    with taking 'is 'at off every time as 'e 'ears 'It's a long
    long way to Tipperary.' Why, I've knowed men," said Mr. Punt,
    in the manner of one who works himself up to an almost
    incredible climax&mdash;"I've knowed men as couldn't tell the
    difference between a linnet's note and a goldfinch."</p>

    <p>"Astonishing," I said.</p>

    <p>One of the canaries suddenly broke into a rich trill of
    song, as if to add his personal expression of surprise.</p>

    <p>"Now there!" Mr. Punt exclaimed, shaking a podgy forefinger
    at him. "There's the bird as give all the trouble and cause
    words 'tween me and Maria, 'e did. 'Artz Mountain roller, that
    bird is. Beeutiful 'is note, ain't it, Sir?"</p>

    <p>There really was a deep full tone, distantly suggestive of a
    nightingale's, that favourably distinguished the bird's song
    from the canary's usual acute treble.</p>

    <p>"'I'm doubting, Maria,' I say to 'er," Mr. Punt resumed. "No
    longer ago than this very morning I say it&mdash;'I'm doubting
    whether I did ought to call that 'ere bird a 'Artz Mountain
    roller,' I say to 'er&mdash;me meaning, o' course, as the 'Artz
    Mountains being, as some thinks, in Germany, that pussons
    wouldn't so much as go to look at a canary as called 'isself a
    'Artz Mountain bird, as it might be a German bird, for all as
    'e'd never a-bin no nearer Germany than the Royal Road,
    Chelsea, not never since 'e chip 'is little shell, 'e
    'aven't.</p>

    <p>"So I ask 'er the question, doubting like, and she up and
    say, all saucy as a jay-bird, 'Why, certainly you didn't ought
    to call 'im so,' she say.</p>

    <p>"'Question is, Maria,' I says, 'in that case what did I
    ought to call 'im?'</p>

    <p>"'And I can tell yer that too, Dad,' she say&mdash;Maria
    did. 'You didn't ought to call 'im 'Artz Mountain roller, but
    ha-Hartz Mountain roller. That's the way to call 'im,' she
    says&mdash;impident little 'ussy! But there&mdash;what's in a
    name, as the white blackbird said when 'e sat on a wooden
    milestone eating a red blackberry? Still, 'e weren't running a
    live-stock emporium, I expect, when 'e ask such a question as
    that 'ere. There's a good deal in 'ow you call a bird, or a
    dawg or a guinea-pig neither, if you want to pass 'im on to a
    customer in a honest way o' trade."</p>

    <p>I assured Mr. Punt I had not a doubt of it.</p>

    <p>"But I shall be a-practisin' my haitches, Sir," he promised
    me, as I went out with the canary seed which I had called to
    purchase&mdash;"practise 'em 'ard, I shall. It's what I ain't
    a-got at the present moment&mdash;'a fine ear for the
    haspirate.' Beeutiful expression that, Sir, if you'll excuse me
    sayin' so. But I don't see no reason as a man mightn't 'ope to
    acquire it, 'im practising constant and careful&mdash;same as a
    pusson can learn a bullfinch to pipe ''Ome, sweet 'Ome.' That
    haitch is a funny letter, but it's a letter as I shall
    practise. Still, haitches or no haitches," he concluded, with a
    profound sigh, "I wish as I knowed 'ow I could set about coming
    it over that 'ere one-legged widder lidy at Putney what 'ave
    the two great hauk's eggs."</p>

    <p>Out of the dusty twilight in the far end of the shop Mrs.
    Punt's eye gleamed balefully.</p>

    <h2>BLIGHTY IMPRESSIONS.</h2>

    <h3>THE BARBER.</h3>

    <p>I went into a tobacco-shop, tendered a pound note and asked
    for a packet of cigarettes and a box of matches. With much
    regret and a smiling face, she informed me she had the goods
    but no change.</p>

    <p>What a dilemma! A shop with cigarettes and matches, but I
    couldn't spare a pound note for them.</p>

    <p>An inspiration!&mdash;I would go into the hairdressing
    establishment behind the shop, have a shave&mdash;which I
    really didn't need&mdash;obtain change and make my purchase.
    Besides, with so many barbers closed owing to the strike, it
    was an opportunity.</p>

    <p>This is what happened.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, Sir. Your turn next but six."</p>

    <p>A long, long interval.</p>

    <p>"Shave, Sir? Lovely weather we're having. Razor all right,
    Sir?"</p>

    <p>I said as little as possible; it is the only safe thing.</p>

    <p>"Face massage, Sir?"</p>

    <p>"No, thanks," I mumbled.</p>

    <p>"Wonderful thing for the face, Sir; make a new man of you.
    Invigorates the circulation, improves the
    complexion&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, all right," I gasped.</p>

    <p>And then for about twenty minutes snatches of conversation
    floated to me through bundles of wet towels. My head was having
    a Turkish bath. My face was covered with ointments and creams.
    Currents of electricity played about my brow.</p>

    <p>"Just trim your hair, Sir?"</p>

    <p>I swear I said "No," but before I knew what was happening
    the scissors were running merrily over my head.</p>

    <p>"Singeing, Sir?"</p>

    <p>"Er&mdash;no. I&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Finest thing in the world, Sir. It's a treat to see hair
    like this. Just a bit 'endy,' but singeing will soon put that
    right."</p>

    <p>Even had I been blind I should have discovered that I was
    undergoing the process.</p>

    <p>"What would you like for the shampoo, Sir? Eau de
    Quinine&mdash;Violet&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I don't think&mdash;"</p>

    <p>My feeble protest was cut
    short.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>

    <p>"I always recommend Violet," he said, sprinkling my head
    profusely.</p>

    <p>More rubbing, more towels, more electricity and finally a
    brush and comb.</p>

    <p>"I've a hair-lotion here, Sir&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, thank you."</p>

    <p>I meant it.</p>

    <p>He helped me on with my coat, brushed off a deal of
    imaginary dust, said something about skin softeners and bath
    requisites, but I'd had enough for one morning, and I was
    yearning to get those cigarettes and have a smoke.</p>

    <p>I tendered my pound note.</p>

    <p>He took it, and with his best smile said&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Another sixpence, Sir, please."</p>

    <h3>THE OLD INVINCIBLE.</h3>

    <p>It is late in the day to draw attention to Mr. Punch as a
    prophet. Everyone knows that his eyes have always discerned the
    farthest horizon. None the less it is pleasant now and again to
    succumb to the temptation of saying "I told you so," and
    especially when it is the finger of a friendly reader that
    points the way to the Sage's triumph. Were we in the habit of
    quoting from past numbers, as many of our contemporaries do, we
    should print the following paragraph from the issue of
    September 2nd, 1871:&mdash;</p>

    <h4>"A REAL DANGER.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"'According to <i>Le Havre</i>, about forty Prussian
        officers in mufti leave Dieppe every morning for England,
        their object being to visit the military establishments of
        Great Britain.'</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"Here at last is an actual invasion! Prussian officers
    landing on our defenceless shores, on the transparently flimsy
    pretext of making themselves acquainted with our military
    establishments, at the rate (excluding Sundays) of 240 a week,
    or in this present September, of 1,080 a month, or, amazing and
    terrifying total, of 12,520 a year! We commend this startling
    announcement to the attention of the Cabinet (Parliament,
    unfortunately, is not sitting), the Commander-in-Chief, the War
    Office, the Commanders of all Volunteer Corps, the Author of
    'The Battle of Dorking,' <i>Sergeant Blower</i>, and <i>Cheeks

    everything.</p>

    <p>Interviewed by a correspondent, Mr. Raleigh Quawe, the able
    young educationist, who, it is understood, is watching the
    experiment with some concern, said, "While I do not wish to
    seem to be giving away too much to the gloom of youth, I cannot
    help feeling that the school may be run on wrong lines unless
    the greatest care is exercised. Will the opportunity be taken
    for testing methods which have been so disastrously absent
    hitherto from our public school system? I would urge those in
    authority to put away the old formulæ, and to ensure the
    introduction of a right spirit in the school by the appointment
    of young masters endowed with vision and enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>"I hope that the worship of sport will not be encouraged. I
    was never one who believed that our battles have been won on
    the playing-fields of Westminster. I am confident that I am not
    alone in the hope that the old games at Westminster will be
    abandoned.</p>

    <p>"It is most important that there should be no suppression of
    the emotional nature. Rob politics of emotion and the
    newspapers are not worth reading; and it must not be forgotten
    that what Westminster does to-day is read of by the British
    Empire to-morrow. No effort should be spared to awaken the
    artistic sense of the pupils. If the pictures and sculptures in
    and about the corridors of the Houses of Parliament are not
    enough, let others be prepared. No expense should be spared.
    For my part I see no reason why a little music should not be
    introduced occasionally.</p>

    <p>"Freedom of opinion should also be encouraged. One fault of
    our educational system has been its tendency to produce
    mass-thinking. This will never do among our Unionist Members of
    Parliament. Yes, I would even advocate that some of the seniors
    should be allowed to read <i>The Herald</i> if they wished to
    do so, and I question whether <i>The Nation</i> would do any of
    them any harm."</p>

    <p>I had intended to write the whole of this article in verse,
    of which the above is a shocking sample, but, on the whole, I
    think I will go on in prose. When you have committed yourself
    to double rhymes, prose is the easier medium. In verse it is
    more difficult to stick to your subject, and as the subject in
    this case is a very important one and deserves to be stuck to,
    I shall do the rest in prose.</p>

    <p>Anyhow, the fact is that I have read a paragraph in one of
    the papers about a proposed revival of rowing. Rowing, like
    other sports, has, it seems, lain dormant for the past four
    years and a half. From the moment in 1914 when war was declared
    it suffered a land-change; shorts and zephyr and blazer and
    sweater were abandoned at once, and, for the oarsman as for
    everybody else, khaki became the only wear. Already trained by
    long discipline to obey, our oarsmen trooped to the colours,
    and wherever hard fighting was to be done their shining names
    are to be found on the muster-roll of fame. Some will return to
    us, but for others there waited the <i>eternum exitium
    cymbæ</i>&mdash;a very different craft from those to which they
    were accustomed, but they accepted it with pride and without a
    murmur.</p>

    <p>Bearing these things in mind, I went to Henley last week to
    interview Father Thames. I found the veteran totally unchanged
    in his quarters on the Temple Island, and immediately began the
    interview.</p>

    <p>"Dull?" he said. "I believe you, my boy. But they tell me
    there's talk of reviving the regatta. You tell them with my
    compliments not to be in too great a hurry about it. Think of
    what Henley meant to the lads who rowed. They hadn't learnt
    their skill in a day&mdash;no, nor in as many days as go to a
    year."</p>

    <p>"Do you then," I said, "consider the regatta only from the
    oarsman's point of view?"</p>

    <p>"Really," said the old gentleman, "there's no other. Not but
    what," he added with a chuckle, "it gave them more pleasure to
    row their races with lots of pretty faces to look on. Lor'
    bless you, I don't object to 'em. It's the prettiest scene in
    the world when the sun shines as it sometimes does. And that's
    enough talking for one afternoon." With that he plunged, and
    nothing I did could bring him to the surface again.</p>

    <h2>OUR BIVVIE.</h2>

    <p>"Not a bad possie," said George, looking round the village.
    "Let's rustle a bivvie before the crowd comes along."</p>

    <p>All George's performances in the art of rustling bivvies
    rank as star. He permits no coarse and obvious gathering of an
    expectant horde about the opening door; no slacking of straps
    and bootlaces until the final "I will" is said on either side.
    He debouches in extended order on the doomed house; gets his
    range and has the barrage well in hand (the quantity and
    quality of Madame's gesticulations furnish the key to this)
    before Colin drifts off the horizon and shows a peaked face
    with haunting eyes over George's shoulder. Colin does not
    speak. That is not his <i>métier</i>. He is the star shell
    illuminating the position; and usually in about six minutes'
    time it is safe for John to put in an appearance with the
    kit.</p>

    <p>This is the recognised procedure, and it has served us
    indifferently well up and down three years of war and a good
    deal of France and Flanders. Therefore John was not to blame
    when, after waiting the scheduled six minutes, he arrived to
    find the other two still in the thick of it. Either Colin was
    not haunting up to form (which was likely, as he had been
    over-fed lately) or George's French (which was never made in
    the place where they make marriages) had scandalised
    Madame.</p>

    <p>She stood in the door like some historical personage,
    probably the Sphinx, and repeated a guttural kind of
    incantation while George stretched his ears until they stood
    out more than usual in a struggle to understand.</p>

    <p>"Rotten patois some of these people speak," he said. "I
    believe she has a room, though something's biting her. Likely
    enough Fritz went off with all her furniture; but I've already
    explained twenty times that that doesn't matter. <i>Écoutez,
    Madame.</i> We only want a room. <i>Chambre-à-coucher.</i> We
    can furnish it. We have three beds. <i>Trois lits.</i>
    <i>Trois</i> stretcher-beds sent over from <i>Angleterre</i>.
    <i>À la gare.</i> We've just seen them. <i>Trois lits nous
    avons.</i> Three beds."</p>

    <p>"Beds!" Madame pounced on the word. "<i>C'est cela!</i> No
    beds, <i>Monsieur</i>. <i>Je n'en ai pas.</i>"</p>

    <p>"Ah, now we know where we are." George looked round
    triumphantly. "<i>Écoutez, Madame.</i> We don't want beds.
    <i>Nous les desirons jamais.</i> We have them. <i>Trois
    lits.</i> We don't want them. We have beds.
    <i>Comprenez?</i>"</p>

    <p>"No beds," explained Madame firmly.</p>

    <p>"But I've just told you&mdash;" George plunged again into
    the maelstrom, and a pretty girl appeared from the firelit room
    behind to stir him to his highest flights of eloquence. A smell
    of savoury cooking came also, and out in the street night shut
    down dark and chill and sinister, as it does in all the best
    novels. John let part of the kit down on the door-sill. It was
    his way of explaining that at the present moment there was a
    deeper, more intimate call than the Call of the Wild. Colin
    moved up a step and turned the haunting-stop full on. George
    redoubled his efforts, making them very clear indeed. We could
    understand almost every word he said.</p>

    <p>Then Madame answered, and we could understand that
    too.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>

    <p>"No beds," she said.</p>

    <p>The pretty girl smiled in a troubled way and murmured
    something in a soft voice.</p>

    <p>"She says they haven't got any beds in the rooms. Fritz took
    them all," interpreted George. "<i>Écoutez, Mademoiselle</i>.
    We have beds. <i>Trois lits. Nous les avons. Tous les trois.
    Oui. À la gare. Absolument</i>."</p>

    <p>Mademoiselle looked at Madame with a kink of her pretty
    brows. Madame rose like a balloon to the need.</p>

    <p>"No beds," she said very distinctly, with a rounding of eyes
    and mouth. "No beds, Messieurs. No-o-o&mdash;<i>beds</i>."</p>

    <p>Before George could recover John interfered. He makes a
    hobby of cutting Gordian knots.</p>

    <p>"Oh, what's the earthly use of telling 'em we have beds when
    they can see for themselves that we haven't? They just think we
    can't understand. Let's go up and take the rooms if they're
    decent. Then we'll get the stretchers and put 'em up. That's
    the only sort of argument we can handle."</p>

    <p>Manfully George went to work again. And reluctant, and yet
    obviously fascinated by his French, like a bird by a snake,
    Mademoiselle led up the narrow stairs and into a sizeable room,
    clean as a pin and as naked. On the threshold Madame washed her
    hands of hope.</p>

    <p>"<i>Regardez!</i> No beds. <i>C'est affreux!</i>"</p>

    <p>George began again. He had courage. Whatever else Nature and
    luck denied him there was no question of that. For a little it
    looked as though he were in sight of the goal. Then
    Mademoiselle explained. They were <i>désolées</i>, but the
    <i>sales Boches</i> had stolen all the beds, and Madame would
    not let the bare rooms to <i>Messieurs les Anglais</i>. It
    would not be <i>convenable</i> when they had no beds.</p>

    <p>"No beds!" Madame appealed to the skylight as witness, and
    we looked at each other. It was getting late and the others
    would have rustled all the best bivvies by now. John had
    another brain-wave.</p>

    <p>"Let's pantomime it. They always understand pantomime.
    There's no use <i>saying</i> we've got beds&mdash;not when
    George has to say it. We'll show them."</p>

    <p>Earnestly we pantomimed stretcher beds&mdash;our own
    stretcher beds&mdash;and reposeful slumber thereon. "<i>Mon
    Dieu!</i>" cried Mademoiselle, retreating in haste. "No beds,"
    repeated Madame, unconvinced and unafraid.</p>

    <p>"She means that she doesn't want to have us," said John in
    cold despair.</p>

    <p>"She'd be a fool if she did now," answered Colin grimly.
    "Let's get out of this."</p>

    <p>And then John had a third brain-wave. He ordered George on
    guard, and descended with Colin in search of the concrete proof
    of our sanity. And Madame's voice, faint yet pursuing, followed
    us down.</p>

    <p>"No beds," it said.</p>

    <p>In ten minutes we were back triumphant with the three
    stretchers. It was a full six months since we had written to
    England for them, and they had come at last. Visions of rest
    went upstairs with us, and under the big eyes of Madame and
    Mademoiselle and several more Madames who had collected as
    unobtrusively as a silk hat collects dust we slashed at the
    coverings, ripped them off and disclosed&mdash;three
    deck-chairs.</p>

    <p>We did not attempt to meet the situation. We left it to the
    devil&mdash;or Madame. And she, with the lofty serenity of one
    who through long and grievous misunderstanding has won home at
    last, was completely adequate.</p>

    <p>"No beds," she said.</p>

    <h2>THE WAR-DOG'S PARTY.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Continued.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I expected, of course, when I declared the resolution, "Dogs
    not Doormats," open for general discussion that there would be
    some pretty plain barking, but nothing calling for the
    intervention of the Chair. Britain's dogs are sound at heart,
    even if they do talk a bit wildly about the Tyranny of Man and
    Rabbitism and Abolishing the Biscuiteer. I don't agree with a
    lot of it myself&mdash;we Airedales have always been
    conservatively inclined; but I am bound to say that three years
    in the Army open one's eyes to a lot of things.</p>

    <p>Nothing of a really seditious character was said until the
    Borzoi commenced to address the meeting. I had always disliked
    the fellow and half suspected him of being an Anarchist or the
    president of some brotherhood or other. (It's funny how these
    rascals, whose one idea is to get something which belongs to
    somebody else without working for it, always call themselves a
    brotherhood.) But those Russian dogs have such a shifty
    slinking way with them that you can't always tell what they are
    driving at. This Borzoi chap had tried once or twice to
    interest me in what he called the Community of Bones doctrine,
    but I soon found out that his master was a conscientious
    objector and a vegetarian and that the doctrine really meant
    that he would do the communing and I would provide the
    bones.</p>

    <p>The rogue began with some fulsome ingratiating remarks about
    how pleased he was to see so many fine representatives of the
    canine race prepared to maintain intact their sovereign doghood
    whatever the sacrifice might entail. This brought loud applause
    from the young hotheads; but I noticed traces of disgust along
    the backs of the older dogs. The time had passed, he continued,
    for speeches and resolutions and votes of censure. Dogs must
    act if Man, the enemy, was to be finally crushed. I intervened
    at this point and told the Borzoi he must moderate his
    language, upon which he began to bluster, shouting that he
    would not be put down by an arrogant hireling of effete
    Militarism. One learns to practise self-control in the
    trenches, so I was able to repress an inclination to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> assert my authority then and
       there. It was no use striking at man himself, he went on,
       for he had guns and whips and stones at his command. We must
       strike at him through his children.</p>

    <p>Cries of dissent greeted this statement, and I really think
    the matter would have ended then and there only it so happened
    that none of those present were personally interested in
    children, except old Betty the bulldog, who belongs to four
    little girls who treat her sovereign doghood in a most
    disrespectful way. But old Betty had gone to sleep, and,
    anyway, she is rather deaf and has no teeth, so it's likely she
    would have confined herself to a formal snuffle of protest.
    "Yes," shouted the Borzoi, now thoroughly worked up, "let every
    dog take a solemn oath to bite every child on every possible
    occasion&mdash;at least when no one is looking&mdash;and Man,
    the oppressor, will soon come begging for mercy and make peace
    with us on our own terms. No false loyalty or ridiculous sense
    of chivalry must withhold us," he continued. "The baby in the
    pram to-day is the man with the whip of to-morrow and must be
    bitten with all the righteous fury of outraged doghood." Cries
    of "Shame!" greeted this remark. I decided that it was time to
    interpose. With all the severity at my command I bade the
    wretch be silent.</p>

    <p>"Fellow dogs," I said, "it is clear that we must choose here
    and now, once and for all, between Britishism and Bolshevism.
    Tails up those who wish to remain British!" And of course every
    tail went up. "Tails up, the Bolshevists!" But the Borzoi's was
    down beyond recall and shivering between his legs. "That being
    your decision, ladies and gentlemen," I continued, "the meeting
    will constitute itself a Committee of Safety. Remarks have been
    passed about your Chairman and the canine forces of His Majesty
    that cannot be allowed to go unchallenged. All I ask is plenty
    of room and no favour."</p>

    <p>All this time the Borzoi had been edging towards the door,
    and I really think he would have tried to make a dash for it,
    only at the last minute he caught the eye of the Irish
    wolfhound. It's no good running away from a dog like that, so
    Bolshy decided to stay and face the music. Well, as I said
    before, we war dogs are supposed to be as modest as we are
    brave, so I will confine myself to saying that down our way
    Bolshevism hasn't a leg to stand on. Of course Master, when he
    saw my ear, pretended to be angry, but he knows a war dog
    doesn't fight except for his country, and when the Borzoi's
    owner came round next day to complain Master told him he was a
    miserable Pacifist and had no <i>locus standi</i>. I told
    Master afterwards that the Borzoi had no <i>loci standi</i>
    either, because I'd jolly well nearly chewed them off; and he
    laughed and gave me a whole cutlet with a lot of delicious meat
    on it, saying he wasn't hungry himself.</p>

    <p>Of course we dogs met again and adopted the rest of our
    platform; and I don't mind saying I kept a pretty tight grip on
    the proceedings. In fact, several resolutions, such as those
    dealing with "Municipal Dog's-meat," "Rabbits in Regent's
    Park," "The Prosecution of Untruthful Parlourmaids," "Shorter
    Fur and Longer Legs," were carried without discussion.
    Naturally the meetings concluded with a vote of thanks to the
    Chair, to which I replied (they tell me) felicitously.</p>

    <p>That is how the War Dogs' Party came into being; and
    to-morrow I shall tell that little terrier fellow from No. 10,
    Downing Street, that as long as his master remains faithful to
    the Dog-in-the-Street the War Dogs' Party will remain faithful
    to him.</p>

    <h2>AN EXPENSIVE AMUSEMENT.</h2>

    <p>"As," says one of Mr. Punch's many and very welcome
    correspondents, "you will probably be writing for the benefit
    of your readers a short handbook on how to be demobilised, I
    enclose for your guidance my solicitor's bill. He was engaged
    from November 12th until I returned home on leave on December
    30th and took a hand in the game myself. The chief work was
    tracing the various Government Departments to their hidden
    lairs in which they indulge in the pleasing habit of exchanging
    minutes.</p>

    <p>"Some day perhaps demobilisation will reach me. The sooner
    the better, for I can never settle this account on my Army
    pay."</p>

    <p>So much for the preamble. Here, with the alteration only of
    certain names, is the document itself. Mr. Jones, it should be
    mentioned, is a member of the firm to which the Officer in
    question (whom we will call Mr. Lute) wishes to
    return:&mdash;</p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I own that to find the publishers, those sometimes too
    generous critics, writing upon the wrapper of <i>An English
    Family</i> (HUTCHINSON) an appreciation that bracketed it with
    <i>The Newcomes</i>, did little to predispose me in its favour.
    Later, however, when I had read the book with an increasing
    pleasure, I was ready to admit that the comparison was by no
    means wholly unjustified. Certainly Mr. HAROLD BEGBIE has
    written a very charming story in this history of the
    <i>Frothinghams</i> and the growth of their typically English
    characters, maturing just in time for the ordeal that has
    tested and (one is proud to think) triumphantly approved the
    spirit of our country. In fact these memoirs of <i>Hugh
    Frothingham</i> are something more than an idle romance; there
    is an allegory in them, and some touch of propaganda, cunningly
    introduced in the fine character of <i>Torrance</i>, the great
    surgeon who married one of the <i>Frothingham</i> girls and was
    bombed in the hospital raids. Through the varied activities of
    the family, as they develop, passes the cleverly-shown figure
    of <i>Hugh</i>, the narrator, who, starting with fairer
    prospects than any of the others, is ruined by indolence and an
    income, and hardly saved by the War from degenerating into the
    torpid existence of a social pussy-cat. <i>Hugh</i> is an
    admirable example of the difficult art of seemingly unconscious
    self-revelation. Altogether I have found <i>An English
    Family</i> greatly to my taste, displaying as it does a dignity
    and breadth that recall not unworthily the best traditions of
    the English novel. But did we speak of <i>Serbia</i> in 1914? I
    only ask.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p><i>High Adventure</i> (CONSTABLE) is in certain ways the
    most fascinating account of flying and of fliers which has come
    my way. Captain NORMAN HALL, already well known to readers of
    <i>Kitchener's Mob</i>, tells us in this later book how he
    became a member of the Escadrille Américaine and how he learned
    to fly. And, as his modesty is beyond all praise, I feel sure
    that he will forgive me for saying that it is not the personal
    note which is here so specially attractive. What makes his book
    so different from other books on flying is that in it we have a
    novice suffering from all sorts of mishaps and mistakes before
    he has mastered the difficulties of his art. Whether
    consciously or not Captain HALL performs a very great service
    in describing the life of a flier while his wings are&mdash;so
    to speak&mdash;only in the sprouting stage. In an introduction
    Major GROS tells us of the work done by American pilots before
    America entered the War, a delightful preface to a book which
    both for its matter and style is good to read.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>I confess at once that <i>The Uprooters</i> (STANLEY PAUL)
    is a story that I have found hard to understand. There seems an
    idea somewhere, but it constantly eluded me. To begin with,
    exactly who or what were the Uprooters, and what did they
    uproot? At first I thought the answer was going to name
    <i>Major</i> and <i>Mrs. Elton</i>, who for no very sufficient
    reason would go meddling off to Paris, and transporting thence
    the brother and sister <i>Ormsby</i> to Ireland. The
    <i>Ormsbys</i> had been happy and (apparently) harmless enough
    hitherto, but once uprooted they promptly developed the most
    unfortunate passions&mdash;reciprocated, moreover&mdash;for
    their well-wishers. The obvious and laudable moral of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> which is, never remove your
       neighbour from his chosen landmarks. Later, however, it
       became apparent that Mr. J.A.T. LLOYD had a more subtle
       interpretation for his title in the activities of a band of
       pacifists, headed by a multi-millionaire, who called himself
       an American, though somehow his name, <i>Schwartz</i>,
       hardly inspired me with any feelings of real confidence. On
       his death-bed, however, this gentleman reveals blood of the
       most Prussian blue, confessing that his wealth has actually
       been derived from the dividends of Frau BERTHA; and as the
       War has by this time resolved the emotional difficulties of
       the other characters the story comes to its somewhat
       procrastinated finish. My own belief in it had to endure two
       tests, of which the less was inflicted by a scene
       specifically placed in a "dim <i>second class</i> carriage"
       on the L.&amp;N.W.R. in 1916; and the greater by the <i>cri
       de coeur</i> of the lady, whose husband surprised her with
       her lover: "Edmund, get that murderous look out of your
       eyes, the look of that dreadful ancestor in the portrait
       gallery!" I ask you, does that carry conviction under the
       circumstances?</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Really, the delight of the publishers over <i>Cecily and the
    Wide World</i> (HURST AND BLACKETT) is almost touching. On the
    outside of the wrapper they call it "charming," and are at the
    further pains to advise me to "read first the turnover of
    cover," where I find them letting themselves go in such terms
    as "true life," "sincerity," "charm" (again), "courage," and
    the like. The natural result of all which was that I approached
    the story prepared for the stickiest of American cloy-fiction.
    I was most pleasantly disappointed. Miss ELIZABETH F. CORBETT
    has chosen a theme inevitably a little sentimental, but her
    treatment of it is throughout of a brisk and tonic sanity,
    altogether different from&mdash;well, you know the sort of
    stuff I have in mind. <i>Cecily</i> was the discontented wife
    of <i>Avery Fairchild</i>, a young doctor with three children
    and a fair practice. After a while her discontent so increased
    that she betook herself to the wide, wide world, to live her
    own life. And as both she and <i>Avery</i> before long fell
    cheerfully in love with other persons I suppose the move could
    so far be counted a success. Before, however, the divorce
    facilities of the land of freedom could bring the tale to one
    happy ending an accident to <i>Cecily's</i> motor and the long
    arm that delivered her to her husband's professional care
    brought it to another. I am left wondering how this dénouement
    would have been affected if <i>Avery</i> had been, say, a
    dentist, or of any other calling than the one that so obviously
    loaded the dice in his favour. I repeat, however, a distinctly
    well-written and human story, almost startlingly topical too in
    one place, where <i>Dr. Avery</i> observes, "There's a lot of
    grippe in town, and it's a thing that isn't reported to the
    Health Department." The obvious inference being that it ought
    to be. <i>Avery</i>, you observe, had more practical sense than
    the majority of heroes, few of whom would ever have thought of
    this, or, at any rate, mentioned it.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Baroness ORCZY's romance of old Cambrai, <i>Flower o' the
    Lily</i> (HODDER AND STOUGHTON), should not be regarded as in
    any way bearing upon the more modern history of that remarkable
    city. It has nothing to do with our war; it has a war of its
    own, a rapid affair of bows and arrows, scaling ladders and
    such desperate situations as can be, and were, saved by the
    arrival of the right man, single-handed, in the right place at
    the right moment. Familiar as is his type in novels of this
    adventurous kind, I think I shall never tire of the consummate
    swordsman hero who impersonates, for political and matrimonial
    ends, a man of infinitely higher degree but far less real worth
    than himself, handling the vicarious business with an
    incredible adroitness, but mistakenly carrying by storm the
    love of the lady for himself. The lady is so confoundedly
    attractive in these circumstances, possibly because there is
    about them a tonic which lends additional colour to the
    feminine cheek and a new brilliance to the eye. And, however
    bitter may be the first moment when the true personalities are
    divulged, it all comes right in the end. Here is a story of
    intrigue and battle and love, written in the necessary
    phraseology of the time and woven round (and, I trust,
    consistent with) the historical contest between the Spanish and
    French Powers, disputing the terrain of Flanders; in every way
    a worthy successor of <i>The Scarlet Pimpernel</i>. It is
    inevitable to suggest that this story should also be dramatised
    in due course; it would make as a play an instant and
    irresistible appeal to that great public which loves the
    theatre most when it is most theatrical. And it is doubtless
    destined also for the Movies.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
